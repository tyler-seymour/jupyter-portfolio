    "This notebook uses natural language processing techniques to model topics in a patent portfolio. The model is useful to break a large group of patents into natural technology groupings. It then generates an interactive visualization which can be exported to HTML and used to further the contents of the portfolio. In this example, 1000 patent abstracts in US Class 705, for software and business method patents, are analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workhorse in this analyis is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (\"LDA\"), an unsupervised topic modeling technique. As it is used here, each patent abstact is divided into a sets of topics, and each topic is a set of technology-related words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The abstacts are pre-processed to remove frequently occuring patent jargon and other stop words. This increases the quality of the technology topics the system is able to identify. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of technology groupings is currently set at 7, for processing-time's sake. LDA fits the abstracts into an aribtrary, pre-set number of technology groupings.  the "
